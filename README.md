# Alces Underware

Tool/library for managing standard config hierarchy and template rendering
under-lying Alces clusters and other Alces tools.

## Supported platforms

* Enterprise Linux 6 distributions: RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux (`el6`)
* Enterprise Linux 7 distributions: RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux (`el7`)

## Prerequisites

The install scripts handle the installation of all required packages from your
distribution and will install on a minimal base.  For Enterprise Linux
distributions installation of the `@core` and `@base` package groups is
sufficient.

## Installation

For installation instructions please see INSTALL.md

## Usage

Underware is designed to be used both as a library by other Alces tools, and as
an independent tool in its own right. Documentation has not yet been written on
using it as a library; see below for documentation on using it as a tool.

The application can be invoked directly using the `bin` executable:
```
# bin/underware
  NAME:

    underware

  DESCRIPTION:

    Tool for managing standard config hierarchy and template rendering under-lying Alces
clusters and other Alces tools

... etc ...
```

### Creating a new cluster

A new generic cluster can be created using the `init` command. It will ask a few
questions about the cluster such as its name. Then it will generate an
one compute/ ten node cluster. 

```
# bin/underware init CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER
Name of the cluster (1/6)
> ?

... etc ..
```

The `CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER` is a label used to manage the cluster from the command
line. All commands that require a cluster input will use this identifier. It is
unrelated to the `cluster_name` which is set by the question. This is to allow
clusters with the same name but different configurations.

#### Creating a bare cluster

The `init` command can also create a cluster without any nodes using the
`--bare` flag. This skips the configuration of the `domain` and any `nodes`.
It does however create the cluster's basic directory structureÂ· It further
configuration needs to use the `configure` commands.

```
# bin/underware init CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER --bare
(no questions asked)
```

### Advanced domain configuration

Once the cluster has been created, further configuration can be done by using 
the `configure` commands. The `init` questions can be re-asked by reconfiguring
the domain. Unlike the `init` command, this will not recreate the directory
structure.

```
bin/underware configure domain
```

### Adding new nodes

A set of nodes can be added using the `configure group` command. The `GROUP_NAME`,
and `NODE_RANGE` need to specified on the command line.

```
# bin/underware configure group GROUP_NAME NODE_RANGE
```

Examples:
```
# Configures 'group1' with a single node 'node1'
bin/underware configure group group1 node1

# Configures 'group2' with a range of nodes: 'n01', 'n02', ..., 'n10'
bin/underware configure group group2 n[01-10]
```

Nodes can be added to additional groups using the `--groups` flag

### Configuring a single node

A singe node can be setup using the `configure node` command. It will
either re-configure an existing node, or add an orphan node.

```
# bin/underware configure node NODE_NAME
```

### Rendering the content

The content templates can be rendered using the `template` command. By default
the templates are rendered to:
`/var/lib/underware/clusters/<CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER>/rendered`

```
# bin/underware template
```
