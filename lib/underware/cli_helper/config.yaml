      The NODE_RANGE specifies the nodes to be added to the group. It supports
      basic alphanumeric naming for a single node. Alternatively, brackets can
      be used to give a node range.
    examples:
      - - Configures 'group1' with a single node 'node1'
        - underware configure group group1 node1
      - - "Configures 'group2' with a range of nodes: 'n01', 'n02', ..., 'n10'"

      This command renders all the templates provided by Underware for every

      configured with.


      Specifically this consists of rendering, for every platform, the
      available domain, group, and node templates (both platform-specific and
      platform-independent content), for the domain, every group, and every
      node respectively.


      The rendered templates will be output to a standard hierarchy under
      `/var/lib/underware/rendered/` and can then be used, on their own or in
      combination with other Alces tools, to deploy, configure, or otherwise
      manage a cluster at different scales and across different platforms.

      The nodes, groups, and domain namepaces can be viewed. The nodes
      and groups have to be followed by the name of the object. The command
      can be delimited by spaces or periods.


      The displayed JSON can be navigated in the same way as templating. This
      means 'alces.domain' will show all domain level parameters, where
      'alces.domain.config' will only show the config.
